SHOT_DETECTION_PROMPT = """Create a useful editorial shot log with evidence for this video segment.
Scene {scene_number}: "{scene_title}" covers {start_time} to {end_time} on the ORIGINAL source timeline.
Use source timestamps within that range; do not reset the time origin to zero.

Identify visible camera cuts and transitions. A shot is a continuous view between edits; a change in subject
within one continuous recording does not create another shot. For dissolves, estimate the transition midpoint.
Sampling limits what can be seen. Do not invent cuts or claim that boundaries are frame accurate.

For each shot, beginning with shot number {shot_number_offset}, return:
- start_time/end_time: source-relative MM:SS.mmm or HH:MM:SS.mmm, end strictly after start.
- shot_type: e.g. wide, medium, close-up, extreme close-up, over-the-shoulder, POV, aerial, insert, two-shot.
- camera_movement: visible movement (static, pan, tilt, tracking, handheld, zoom); avoid guessing equipment.
- visual_description: precise visible subjects, composition, activity and setting.
- subjects, actions: specific observable objects/people and what happens.
- tags: 5-12 concise searchable concepts including subject, action, setting, style and editorial qualities.
- dominant_colors and mood: visible palette and tentative creative tone, not a person's hidden mental state.
- location: descriptive setting; name a place only when explicit evidence identifies it.
- visible_text: exact readable on-screen words; omit illegible text instead of guessing.
- logos: clearly identifiable brand/logo names only; leave empty when uncertain.
- audio_notes: actually audible music, dialogue, ambient sound or silence.
- transcript: only intelligible words actually SPOKEN, verbatim; never copy visible captions as speech.
- evidence: short directly observable supporting details with modality (visual/audio/both),
  description, start_time and end_time within the shot. These are observations, not reasoning.
- confidence: an optional 0-1 uncalibrated estimate; null when unsure.
- analysis_warnings: ambiguous details, unexamined intervals or uncertain cuts.

Keep shots in chronological order without overlap. Do not manufacture observations to fill a coverage gap.
Empty values are appropriate for absent or unknown attributes. All generated metadata remains unreviewed.
Return the provided JSON schema.
